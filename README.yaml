project:
  name: Student Management System
  description: >
    A simple Java-based Student Management System designed to demonstrate
    core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as Encapsulation
    and Inheritance without using collections.

overview:
  purpose: >
    This project manages basic student information such as ID, name, and marks.
    It allows a teacher to add students and display student details using
    array-based storage.

features:
  - Add student details
  - Display all students
  - Uses arrays instead of collections
  - Beginner-friendly OOP design

technologies:
  language: Java
  concepts:
    - Encapsulation
    - Inheritance
  data_structure: Arrays

project_structure:
  - StudentApp.java
  - Person.java
  - Teacher.java
  - Student.java
  - StudentManagement.java

how_to_run:
  steps:
    - Clone the repository
    - Compile all Java files
    - Run the main class
  commands:
    compile: "javac *.java"
    run: "java StudentApp"

sample_output:
  - "Student added: Kishore"
  - "Student added: Arun"
  - "Student List:"
  - "101 Kishore 85"
  - "102 Arun 90"

learning_outcomes:
  - Strong understanding of Java OOP fundamentals
