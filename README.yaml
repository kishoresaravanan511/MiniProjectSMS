Project:
  Name: Student Management System
  Description: >
    #A simple Java-based Student Management System designed to demonstrate
    core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as Encapsulation
    and Inheritance without using collections.

Overview:
  Purpose: >
    #This project manages basic student information such as ID, name, and marks.
    It allows a teacher to add students and display student details using
    array-based storage.

Features:
  - Add student details
  - Display all students
  - Uses arrays instead of collections
  - Beginner-friendly OOP design

Technologies:
  Language: Core Java
  Concepts:
    - Encapsulation
    - Inheritance
    
  Data_structure: Arrays
  
How_to_run:
  Steps:
    - Clone the repository
    - Run the main class
    - javac main_class_name.java
    - java main_class_name in any editors and CMD.
    
    
Sample_output:
  - "Student added: Kishore"
  - "Student added: Arun"
  - "Student List:"
  - "101 ABC 85"
  - "102 XYZ 90"

Learning_outcomes:
